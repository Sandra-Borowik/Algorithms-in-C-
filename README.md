## Made as a part of course that I took part in 2021.
\
### Example of given instructions (for Max-Heap):
\
Write a program that checks whether a sequence of numbers provided through standard input represents a complete max-heap.\
\
Input:\
The first line of the standard input contains a single integer Z (1 ≤ Z ≤ 20) indicating the number of test cases. Each test is defined by two lines:
The first line of the i-th test contains one positive integer ni, representing the number of elements in the i-th sequence (1 ≤ ni ≤ 200).
The second line of the i-th test contains ni integers separated by single spaces, each in the range of 0 to 1000.\
\
Output:\
The standard output should contain Z lines of answers. In the i-th line, the answer should be:\
\
YES (TAK in Polish) if the values in the i-th sequence represent a complete max-heap, or\
NO (NIE in Polish) otherwise.\
\
### Example:
\
For the input:\
4\
12\
74 32 57 20 64 23 15 52 33 65 63 68\
12\
74 65 68 52 64 57 15 20 33 32 63 23\
20\
82 67 80 54 47 75 74 53 16 45 0 11 35 8 67 3 36 6 9 1\
20\
42 71 34 35 57 1 77 71 65 61 73 19 32 36 12 78 39 86 79 74\
\
The correct output should be:\
NO\
YES\
YES\
NO\
